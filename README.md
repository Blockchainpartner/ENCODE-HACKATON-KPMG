# KPMG FRANCE'S PROJECT - ENCODE HACKATON

## 

We wanted to build something around the messaging feature between Ethereum and Starknet.
Vaulti is a bridge where your tokens deposited on L1 doesn't simply sleep and do nothing, they generate you a passive income.

### Tech Stack:

#### L1
Solidity, Truffle, OpenZeppelin, Metamask

#### L2
OpenZeppelin, Cairo, Nile, Argent X, 

#### Front
React, web3React, Starknet-react, Next.js, Tailwindcss, Vercel



## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install 
# or
yarn install
```

Then create a .env file that needs to contain the following values:

```
L1_VAULT_ADDRESS=0x00000000000
L2_BRIDGE_ADDRESS=
L1_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
L2_TOKEN_ADDRESS=
```


Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
